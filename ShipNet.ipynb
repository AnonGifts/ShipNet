Do you know nothing about ships but have a burning desire to sound smart to your ship-spotting acquaintances?\r\n","\r\n","You're in luck! With ShipNet, confusion in ship identification is a thing of the past. Simply upload an image of a large ship, and ShipNet will predict whether it is one of the following types:\r\n","1. Aircraft Carrier\r\n","2. Destroyer\r\n","3. Container ship\r\n","4. Tanker\r\n","5. Cruise ship\r\n","\r\n","Note: ShipNet works best with colour photos of ships taken at a distance on the open sea. ShipNet is only able to accurately classify ships belonging to one of the five types listed above. \r\n","\r\n","Note^2: Please do not abuse ShipNet with images that do not contain ships - it has feelings too."]}]}
